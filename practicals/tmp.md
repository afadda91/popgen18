# Exercise 1: Basic association testing (single SNP analysis)

In this exercise we will go through a couple of simple tests for association.

We will use the statistical software R and look at (imaginary) data from
1237 cases and 4991 controls at two SNP loci.


First open R or Rstudio (either on Ricco or on your own laptop)

Create an appropriate folder in an appropriate place for this exercise

Set the workingdirectory in R to that folder.

Save the file 'basic_association_testing_practical.R' to that folder and open it (in Rstudio or with an editor).

This will allow you to easily add code to the file or run code in R as you solve the exercises below.

## Exercise 1A: the genotype distribution test

Start by opening R by typing R in your terminal window on the server.

We want to test if the disease is associated with the SNPs.


Test if disease is associated with genotype of the first SNP is by running the following code in R:
